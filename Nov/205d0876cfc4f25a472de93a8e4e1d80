                        On Thursday, 10 November, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MAECI) hosts the presentation: “Africa and Us: common perspective challenges in the light of the forecasts by the Economic Outlook 2016”, promoted by the MAECI and the Italian geopolitical journal Limes, in conjunction with the OECD, the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa (AWEPA), FCA and CNH Industrial.

The African continent is of utmost importance for Italian foreign policy: greatly important for Italy’s economic diplomacy, Africa plays a crucial role in global geopolitical balances and is a primary interlocutor in managing the migration crisis, in settling local conflicts and, at the same time, is a fundamental point of reference in promoting the coexistence of different religions.  

The Conference will introduce the OECD’s “African Economic Outlook 2016” Report and will be opened by the Deputy Minister of MAECI, Mario Giro, and the President of the Italian section of the Organization of European and African Parliamentarians, Lia Quartapelle.

The document which, like every year, takes the pulse of the economic and social development of the African continent, will be illustrated by Mario Pezzini, Director of the OECD Development Centre, and submitted to discussion by the representatives of the Institutions particularly engaged with Africa, the Ambassadors of Guinea, Mozambique, Tunisia, Uganda and the corporate representatives of FCA and CNH International.

The Conference, moderated by the Chief Editor of Limes, Lucio Caracciolo, will be closed with remarks by the Secretary General of the MAECI, Elisabetta Belloni.
